# HTB Scripts
Here the scripts that I developed for some specific tasks during the pentesting process in some of the HackTheBox boxes and challenges that I pwned. I do not guarantee that these scripts work for your purposes or that they are free of bugs.

## List of scripts
- **Mango_cracker.py**: Mango script to retrieve the passwords of the existing users thru the NoSQL injection technique
- **Craft_exploit.py**: Craft exploit to inject arbitrary code into the exploitable API and get a reverse shell
- **Json_injector.py**: Allows to inject arbitrary commands due to a exploitable Json.Net API via .NET deserialization
